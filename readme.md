## Internet Whitelister
for school networks, hotels, or locked down computer networks

Allows for whitelisting and checking of domains for validity. A quick replacement to the whitetrash system -- was too complex and had quite a few moving parts.

Right now, the code is VERY rough. To install, run the node server, setup a localhost apache server (coming soon node serving static files), and then configure squid to use program.js as a rewrite_program.

Once again, this code is rough and very much so in development. Enjoy!
